# Varibales are generally named simillaryly to thos in the original paper. However
# it felt simples to have a a vector of Is and one of Js, rather than an IJ array.

#### Gradient calculations (for the Euclidean case) pp.126 of Kruskal(1964)

# There are 3 terms within the sum on the right hand side of the equation
# The first term simply denotes which values affect which elements of X2 and
# whether to add or subtract them. The second and third terms can be calculated
# separately to form a length M vector and an M by L arrau respectively. Then we
# loop over L and M, using the indeces in Is and Js to add t appropriate values to X2.
# We multiply by minus S, since we are interested in the negative gradient.

# Second term
function grhs2!(d, d̂, S_star,T_star,M,res) 
    @turbo for m in 1:M
        res[m] = (d[m]-d̂[m])/S_star - d[m]/T_star
    end
end 
# Third term
function grhs3!(x,d, M,L,res,Is,Js) 
    Imat = view(x,Is,:)
    Jmat = view(x,Js,:)
    @turbo for m in 1:M
        for l in 1:L
            res[m,l] = (Imat[m,l] - Jmat[m,l])/d[m]

#### Monotone rgression pp.126-128 Kruscal(1964)
#The R implementation monMDS also explains this procedure https://github.com/vegandevs/vegan/blob/master/src/monoMDS.f

# The aim is to sort the distances (in DIST) into blocks, such that the mean (d̂) of each block increases
# from first to last i.e. for any given block - the block before it will have a lower d̂ and the one after it will
# have a greater d̂. In Kruskals terms, each block must be downsatisfied (block before it has lower d̂) and up 
# satisfied (block after it has higher d̂).
# To achieve this we start with each element of d having it's own singleton block.
# Starting with the first block, we alternate between checking whether the block is upsatisfied and downsatisfied, whenever the block 
# is not satisfied for a given direction we merge it with the adjacent block in that direction and begin 
# checking that this block is up and down satified. If the current block is both up and down satisfied,
# we move on to the next block and do the same. This procedure continues until all blocks are up and down
# satisfied. 
# The fitted values returned to DHAT are the d̂ values associated with the block each DIST value belongs to.
